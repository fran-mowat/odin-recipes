        <div class="method">
            <p>Method:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square.</li>
                <li>Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop.</li>
                <li>Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.</li>
                <li>Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot.</li>
                <li>Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Stir in the garlic, red pepper, 1 tsp chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin.</li>
                <li>Leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Turn the heat up a bit, add the lean minced beef to the pan and break it up with a spoon.</li>
                <li>Keep stirring for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits.</li>
                <li>Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture.</li>
                <li>Add in a 400g can of chopped tomatoes, ½ tsp dried marjoram, 1 tsp sugar and squirt in about 2 tbsp tomato pure&#233. Stir well.</li>
                <li>Bring the contents of the pan to a boil, give it a good stir and put a lid on the pan. Turn down the heat until it is gently bubbling and leave it for 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Check on the pan occasionally to stir it and make sure the sauce is not drying out. If it is, add a couple of tablespoons of water and make sure that the heat is low enough.</li>
                <li>Drain and rinse a 410g can of red kidney beans in a sieve and stir them into the chilli pot. Bring to the boil again, and gently bubble without the lid for another 10 minutes, adding a little more water if it looks too dry.</li>
                <li>Season the pot with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Replace the lid, turn off the heat and leave the chilli to stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
                <li>Serve with soured cream and plain boiled long grain rice.</li>
